Alright, let's create a simple C++ program for a number-guessing game. The computer will generate a random number, and the user needs to guess it.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

int main() {
    // Seed for random number generation
    std::srand(std::time(0));

    // Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    int secretNumber = std::rand() % 100 + 1;

    int guess;
    int attempts = 0;

    std::cout << "Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\n";
    
    do {
        // Get user's guess
        std::cout << "Enter your guess (1-100): ";
        std::cin >> guess;

        // Check the guess
        if (guess > secretNumber) {
            std::cout << "Too high! Try again.\n";
        } else if (guess < secretNumber) {
            std::cout << "Too low! Try again.\n";
        }

        attempts++;

    } while (guess != secretNumber);

    // Player guessed correctly
    std::cout << "Congratulations! You guessed the number in " << attempts << " attempts.\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and lets the user guess until they correctly identify the number. If you have a specific type of puzzle or game in mind, feel free to provide more details, and I can adjust the code accordingly.
