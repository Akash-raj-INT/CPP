Certainly! Here's a simple C++ code that calculates the probability of different outcomes when flipping two coins:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main() {
    // Assuming fair coins
    const double probability_head = 0.5;
    const double probability_tail = 0.5;

    // Probability of different outcomes
    double both_heads = probability_head * probability_head;
    double one_head_one_tail = 2 * probability_head * probability_tail; // Two ways: H1T2 or T1H2
    double both_tails = probability_tail * probability_tail;

    // Output probabilities
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2);
    std::cout << "Probability of both heads: " << both_heads << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Probability of one head and one tail: " << one_head_one_tail << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Probability of both tails: " << both_tails << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code assumes fair coins, so the probabilities of getting heads or tails for each coin are both set to 0.5. Adjust the probabilities accordingly if the coins are biased.
