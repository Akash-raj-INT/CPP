Certainly! To print "Hello, World!" in Java, you can use the following code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Save this code in a file named `HelloWorld.java` and then compile and run it using a Java compiler.
